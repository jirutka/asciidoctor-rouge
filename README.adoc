This project provides an http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] extension for highlighting source listing blocks using http://rouge.jneen.net/[Rouge] – a pure-ruby code highlighter that is compatible with pygments.

It supports all Asciidoctor features such as http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#callouts[callouts], highlighting of specified lines (attribute `highlight`), http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#passthroughs[passthroughs] inside a code and all other substitutions.

This extension is highly customizable and modular.

*NOTICE:* Asciidoctor already supports for Rouge since https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/blob/master/CHANGELOG.adoc#200-2019-03-22---mojavelinux[version 2.0.0], so this extension is not needed anymore.


== Installation

To install (or update to the latest version):

[source, subs="+attributes"]
gem install {gem-name}

or to install the latest development version:

[source, subs="+attributes"]
gem install {gem-name} --pre


== Usage

Assign `rouge` to the `source-highlighter` attribute in your document’s header or via command-line argument.

[source, subs="+attributes"]
asciidoctor -r {gem-name} -a source-highlighter=rouge Example.adoc


=== Attributes

You can further customize the source block output with additional Rouge attributes:

rouge-css::
  Controls what method is used for applying CSS to the tokens.
  Can be `class` (CSS classes), `style` (inline styles) or `external` (external styles).
  When `class` is used, Rouge styles for the specified theme are included in an HTML header.
  When `external` is specified, CSS classes are used but no styles will be added except when `rouge-theme` is not empty in which case its value is interpreted as a URL to a style sheet and a link to that style sheet will be added to the HTML header.
  Default is `class`.

rouge-theme::
  Sets the name of the Rouge colour theme to use.
  Look into https://github.com/jneen/rouge/tree/master/lib/rouge/themes[lib/rouge/themes] in the Rouge repository for a list of available themes.
  Default is `github`.

rouge-style::
  Alternative name for the `rouge-theme` for compatibility with _asciidoctor-pdf_ (see https://github.com/{gh-name}/issues/3[#3]).

rouge-highlighted-class::
  CSS class to use on a line wrapper element for highlighted lines.
  Default is `highlighted`.

rouge-line-class::
  CSS class to set on a line wrapper element
  Default is `line`.

rouge-line-id::
  Format string for specifying an HTML `id` for each line (e.g. with `rouge-line-id="L%i"` each line of the listing will get an id of the form `id="L1"`, `id="L2"`, etc.). This really only makes sense if the format string is distinct for each source listing, otherwise it will lead to duplicate IDs which makes the generated HTML invalid.
  Default is no line ids.

=== Passing CGI-style options for selected language

Rouge allows passing https://github.com/jneen/rouge#you-can-even-use-it-with-redcarpet[certain options] to its Lexer classes when selecting the language to parse. This feature is also available from within Asciidoctor. So instead of simply writing:

```
[source, console]
```

to select `console` as output language (with its default options) you can also write:

```
[source, "console?prompt=$> "]
```

This will also select `console` as output language but it will additionally set the prompt string to ``$> ``. Options are comma separeted `key=value` pairs which are appended to the language string with a `?`-character. Consult the various https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rouge/Rouge/Lexers[Rouge Lexer] classes to find out which additional options they support.
